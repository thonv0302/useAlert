- [Instructor] In front of you

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,006
is the full list of exercise files

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,006
that accompany this course.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,004
Now, throughout the course,

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,005
I'll be indicating when you should reference

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:15,007
each of these files to enhance your learning experience.

7
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:19,006
As you can see, we have the template and complete files.

8
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:22,009
We also have the raw CSV data files.

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,007
We have the completed database file

10
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,000
and the ETL pipeline script file.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,009
Now, to get these files downloaded to your machine,

12
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,007
here are the steps you take.

13
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:40,002
First, go to the Related to this course area,

14
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:46,002
then click on Show all next to Exercise files.

15
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:50,000
Click Download next to the zipped file.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,001
Once this file has downloaded to your computer,

17
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,001
go to the location where you've downloaded it to,

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,003
right-click to unzip the contents of this file.

19
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,001
If you are on a Mac like myself,

20
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,008
you would need to double-click

21
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:07,000
to unzip the contents of the file.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,004
Once it's unzipped, then you go to that unzipped folder,

23
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,002
and there you'll see the full list of files

24
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,000
that you see here displayed in front of you.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,008
Now, these files are key

26
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,009
to your hands-on learning experience,

27
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,007
and as I mentioned, you can choose to start

28
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:29,003
with the completed versions to see the final result,

29
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,001
then work with the templates

30
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,000
to practice and solidify your skills.
