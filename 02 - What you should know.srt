00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,008
- [Instructor] For this course, here's a heads up

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,004
on what you should know.

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,009
There are a number of exercise files

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,009
accompanying this course,

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
and most of them come in two versions,

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,003
a completed version,

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:18,005
and an incomplete template with just instructions.

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:22,000
Now this setup is designed to give you the flexibility

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,009
to choose your own learning path.

10
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,001
You can start by referencing the completed version,

11
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,004
which I will be using in the course,

12
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:33,004
and this allows you to see the end result

13
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:38,003
and understand the goal before you try your hand at it.

14
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:41,006
Alternatively, you can begin with the template

15
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:45,007
and use the completed version to check your work.

16
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,007
In addition to these files,

17
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,003
there's a completed database file

18
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,003
that includes all the queries

19
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:55,005
I'll be demonstrating throughout the course.

20
00:00:55,005 --> 00:01:00,002
This resource is invaluable for verifying your progress

21
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:03,006
and making sure you're on the right track.

22
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:06,008
The primary objective of this course is for you

23
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:10,007
to design and build a database from scratch.

24
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:14,009
That being said, I highly recommend taking the approach

25
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,000
of building the database step by step

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,002
as you watch the videos.

27
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:24,002
This hands-on method will give you a competent grasp

28
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,006
of the skills and something tangible

29
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,001
to show when you're done.

30
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,002
By the end of this course,

31
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:34,008
you'll have built a fully functional database

32
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:37,007
showcasing your new-found skills.

33
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:40,000
So dive in, stay engaged,

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and let's make this an amazing learning experience.
